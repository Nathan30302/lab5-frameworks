## Part 1: Bootstrap

- Used Bootstrap 5 via CDN.
- Created a responsive layout using a navbar, grid with two columns, a button, and an alert.
- Everything was styled using Bootstrap classes only.

## Part 2: Tailwind CSS

- Used Tailwind CDN.
- Built a responsive card layout with an image, heading, paragraph, and button.
- All styles were written using utility classes.

## Part 3: React.js

- Used CodeSandbox to build a simple interactive component.
- The component displays a welcome message using props.
- A button toggles a message using `useState()`.

## Experience

Bootstrap was fast and easy for basic layout. Tailwind felt flexible and modern but had more classes to write. React was powerful for adding interactivity without manually dealing with the DOM. I now see how these tools work together for modern front-end development.
